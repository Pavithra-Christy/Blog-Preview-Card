## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties for styling
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom Fonts

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use custom properties (CSS variables) to make the design more maintainable. I also improved my skills in creating responsive designs with Flexbox and media queries.

Here’s an example of how I used variables for consistent theming:

```css
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --black: #111;
  --gray: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --font-family: 'Figtree', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to improve the responsiveness of the card further, especially for smaller screens, and enhance the interactivity of elements like the title and author section. I’d also like to experiment with animations.

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - A great platform to practice coding challenges.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - An excellent resource for Flexbox and responsive design tutorials.
